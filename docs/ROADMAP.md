# F.R.O.G. Roadmap

## Project Vision

F.R.O.G. (Fast, Responsive, Organized Graphics) aims to be the most intuitive and performant data visualization tool for exploring CSV, SQLite, and other data formats. Inspired by Rerun's elegant interface, we're building a tool that makes data exploration as enjoyable as playing with a frog in a pond! üê∏

## Current Status (v0.1.0-beta)

### ‚úÖ Core Features Complete

**Data Sources**

## ü§ù How to Help

While the project is in early development, we're focusing on:

1. **Testing**: Try the app with your data, report issues
2. **Feedback**: What visualizations do you need?
3. **Performance**: Help us optimize for large datasets
4. **Documentation**: Improve guides and examples
