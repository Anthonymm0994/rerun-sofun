# Data Visualization Platform

A high-performance, Rust-native data visualization platform for Windows that transforms CSV and SQLite files into beautiful, interactive dashboards. Inspired by [Rerun](https://rerun.io)'s excellent architecture and user experience, but designed specifically for tabular business data.

## Features

- 🚀 **High Performance**: Handle millions of rows at 60 FPS
- 📊 **Smart Templates**: Automatically selects the best visualization based on your data
- 🎯 **Universal Navigation**: Time-based, sequential, or categorical data navigation
- 🎨 **Beautiful UI**: Dark theme inspired by Rerun's design
- 📁 **Simple Input**: Just drag and drop CSV or SQLite files
- 🔄 **Synchronized Views**: Multiple views stay in sync as you navigate
- ⚡ **GPU Acceleration**: WGPU-based rendering for maximum performance

## Architecture

The platform is built as a modular workspace with clear separation of concerns:

```
datavis/
├── crates/
│   ├── dv-core/        # Core abstractions and state management
│   ├── dv-data/        # Data sources (CSV, SQLite)
│   ├── dv-render/      # Rendering abstraction (GPU/CPU)
│   ├── dv-views/       # View implementations (plots, tables)
│   ├── dv-templates/   # Dashboard templates
│   ├── dv-ui/          # UI components (egui-based)
│   └── dv-app/         # Main application
```

## Building

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.75 or later
- Windows 10/11
- Visual Studio 2019 or later (for Windows)

### Build Instructions

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/datavis
cd datavis

# Build in debug mode
cargo build

# Build in release mode (recommended for performance)
cargo build --release

# Run the application
cargo run --release
```

## Usage

1. **Launch the application**
   ```bash
   cargo run --release
   ```

2. **Load your data**
   - Drag and drop a CSV or SQLite file onto the window
   - Or use File → Open from the menu

3. **Navigate your data**
   - Use the navigation bar at the bottom to move through your data
   - Play button for automatic playback
   - Slider for manual navigation
   - Speed control for playback rate

4. **Customize views**
   - Views automatically adapt to your data schema
   - Drag panels to rearrange layout
   - Use View menu to show/hide panels

## Key Design Patterns

### Navigation System
Inspired by Rerun's time control, but generalized for any data type:
- **Temporal**: Navigate through time-series data
- **Sequential**: Navigate through rows/records
- **Categorical**: Navigate through discrete categories

### Template System
Automatically detects the best dashboard layout:
- Time series data → Line plots with time navigation
- Metrics data → Multiple synchronized charts
- Event logs → Table view with filtering
- Generic data → Flexible grid layout

### Performance Optimizations
- Lazy loading with intelligent caching
- GPU-accelerated rendering
- Multi-threaded data processing
- Memory-mapped file access for large datasets

## Development Status

This is a production-quality foundation with the following components implemented:
- ✅ Core navigation engine
- ✅ Application state management  
- ✅ Event system and synchronization
- ✅ CSV data source with schema detection
- ✅ UI shell with theming
- ✅ Navigation bar control
- 🚧 View implementations (plots, tables)
- 🚧 Template matching system
- 🚧 GPU renderer
- 🚧 SQLite support

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please ensure:
- Code follows Rust best practices
- All tests pass
- Performance remains a priority
- UI changes maintain the clean, professional aesthetic
